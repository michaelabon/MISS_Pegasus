## Purpose

I want to make an escort mission for *[Artemis: Spaceship Bridge
Simulator][artemis-home]* that doesn't suck like most escort missions
do.  I'd ideally like it to be fairly dynamic so that it has 
repeated-play value.

## Suggestions? Comments?

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue][new-issue] on
this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll
close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if
you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll
get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue
too, even if you didn't create it.

If you have any playtesting thoughts, I would be especially pleased to
hear them!

## Features

Interesting map placements. Note the dense hiding spots in the nebulae,
the Listening Post that offers fuel (and currently armaments).

If you stay near the Pegasus then it should move towards DS137. Near
means within 1 kilometre. When you first start pushing the Pegasus,
you will spawn a small cluster of fighters.

## Upcoming Features

Once you approach the Pegasus, you should hear reports of Transports
and Destroyers having system malfunctions.
Maybe they are real reports. Maybe they are the Kraliens! Hence the
replayability.

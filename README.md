## Purpose

I want to make an escort mission for *[Artemis: Spaceship Bridge
Simulator][artemis-home]* that doesn't suck.  I'd ideally like it to be fairly
dynamic so that it has repeated-play value.

## Features

I'm on my Mac so I can't say anything about the code other than it doesn't
crash the game (yet). If you stay near the Pegasus then it should move
towards DS137. Near means within 1 kilometre.

## Upcoming Features

Once you approach the Pegasus, you should hear reports of Transports and Destroyers having system malfunctions.
Maybe they are real reports. Maybe they are the Kraliens! Hence the replayability.
